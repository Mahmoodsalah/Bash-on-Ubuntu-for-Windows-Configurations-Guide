# Bash-on-Ubuntu-for-Windows-Configurations-Guide
Bash on Ubuntu for Windows || Configurations Guide (Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program From Udacity) 
This  Guide take from me more than two weeks to can find answers for each problem you may face. 




Step 1:  Install  Windows Linux bash (follow this https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/)

Step 2: check version by command:  
lsb_release -a
if Release:        14.04 so you need to upgrade it to 16

Step 3: Upgrade it by write this command:
sudo do-release-upgrade
for more details (https://www.howtogeek.com/278152/how-to-update-the-windows-bash-shell/)  

Check again by step 2 if it still Release  14 so you need to upgrade windows 10 check this for more details: https://www.windowscentral.com/how-get-windows-10-creators-update

Step 4: download/clone project folder:

for example proj5 folder path after unzip it will be (in case if you download it directly from GitHub)   E:\SDC\proj5

Step 5: open Linux bash for windows, and write this command:
cd "your path"  

Note: you have to write this before path /mnt/  then replace \ to /    and put the path in " "
for example  cd E:\SDC\proj5
will be  cd "/mnt/e/SDC/proj5"

My real example path: 
 cd "/mnt/e/Me/Courses/UDACITY Self-Drive Car Nanodegree/TERM 3/Projects/CarND-Path-Planning-Project-master"

Instead of 
cd E:\Me\Courses\UDACITY Self-Drive Car Nanodegree\TERM 3\Projects\CarND-Path-Planning-Project-master

Step 6: run this command 
./install-ubuntu.sh  

Note: but before it you must download:
git (  apt-get install git )
cmake (  apt-get install cmake )
Make (  apt-get install make )

Note: if you face this: (unable to resolve host) 
try this
run this command:
sudo nano /etc/hosts
and then add:
127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost 
127.0.1.1 ubuntu
then press Ctrl and X
then restart your computer

Note:  if you face this: (N: Ignoring file '50unattended-upgrades.ucf-old' in directory '/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/' as it has an invalid filename extension) 
Just remove it is unnecessary:
sudo rm /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades.ucf-dist
Note: if you face this while install cmake: 
Err:1 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-security/main amd64 linux-libc-dev amd64 4.4.0-83.106
  404  Not Found 

Try this: 
Download the libc6 and coreutils package files into a temporary directory (or wherever you'd like to keep them until the end of their installation): cd /tmp apt-get download libc6 coreutils
Install them: sudo dpkg -i {libc6,coreutils}_*.deb
Fix the remaining packaging issues with Apt:  sudo apt-get install -f

Note: if you fave this (ln: failed to create symbolic link '/usr/lib/libuWS.so': File exists) after installing websocket. This error says the symbolic link already exists. See this post (https://discussions.udacity.com/t/issues-installing-uws-on-ubuntu-16-04/247997/2?u=subodh.malgonde)  to understand what it means. 

You need to run this command from the project directory:
sudo ln -s -f /usr/lib64/libuWS.so /usr/lib/libuWS.so


This is similar to the second last line of the install-ubuntu.sh file, with an extra -f flag. This will force the replacement of the symbolic link. After this remove the websockets folder from the project directory, you donâ€™t need this after installing uWebSockets.


After install all dependencies correctly go ahead with step 7.
Step 7: Build

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && make


Special Thanks: 
I need to thank  @subodh.malgonde and @drive_well  for helping me alot in this guide.
